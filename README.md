# landing-page
Landing page from a design.

This project will follow a design provided by Odin (the self taught course I am on).
The aim is to get my landing page to follow the same layout and most of the styling as the provided design. 
I am given free reign to change the content, colours and fonts as I please.

The two provided documents are listed below:
